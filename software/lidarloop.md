In this section the software _Map Manager_ is presented, which was developed in the context of a master thesis at IMES. With the Map Manager, several maps can be created and connected to each other at certain points (so-called link points).

Since Sobi has to operate in different environments on campus (e.g. indoor in corridors and entrance halls, in elevators or outdoor between the institute buildings) it is necessary to create several maps between which the robot can switch. This not only reduces the size of the individual maps and thus improves the localization and the resource utilization of the computer, but also allows to use different sensor configurations for different environments .

The chapter is divided into the following sections:

1. [Basic principle of the Map Manager](mm_basic_principle.html)

2. [Mapping with the Map Manager on Sobi](mm_mapping.html)

3. [Automated mapping with the map manager](mm_auto_mapping.html)

4. [Saving the maps in .pgm and .yaml](mm_save_maps.html)

5. [Visualization in Rviz](mm_visualization.html)

6. [Troubleshooting](mm_troubleshooting.html)
